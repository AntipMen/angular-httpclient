# angular-httpclient

Practical work with the server is using the HttpClient package in Angular (get, post, put requests).

Working with asynchronous requests with RxJS.

The project logic divided into a server. Work with data and a component in which we can interact by using methods with the server and HTML.

Moreover, error handling is implemented throught of the HttpClient.

Modifying requests in practice are using headers, parameters, and observing through the HttpClient. 
Modifying requests and handling responses are using the HttpInterceptor package.
