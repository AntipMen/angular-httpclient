# AngularHttpclient

Practical work with the server using the HttpClient package in Angular (get, post, put requests).

Working with asynchronous requests with RxJS.

The project logic is divided into a server - where work with data 
and a component - where we interact using methods with the server and html.

Also, error handling is implemented throught of the HttpClient.

Practice of modifying requests using headers, params and observe with HttpClient
and also modifying requests and processing responses using an HttpInterceptor package.
